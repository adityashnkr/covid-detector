We tried to chip in fighting of Covid-19 by helping citizens and medical professionals to predict if they or the patient has contracted the virus or not.
This website detect if a person has Covid-19 using chest X-rays or question that the user answers.
The first iteration only had the questionnaire. Then we added the new feature of classification using chest X-rays which ties in with the concepts of Software development lifecycle.
We got the idea while watching this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Evc5Z1Jcl0&ab_channel=CBCNews]. So if a patient is already in a hospital a X-ray can be taken in a few minutes and any medical staff can predict if the patient has contacted Covid-19 or not without the need of a radiologist. Saving time of doctors and resources such as testing kits especially during shortages or emergencies.
This also helps to provide care to the patient at the earliest and helps flatten the curve.
